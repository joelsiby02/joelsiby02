Does a degree make you an engineer? I don’t think so --- I believe the title is earned by building, failing, learning, and shipping.
===================

Hi 👋 I’m Joel Siby

I’m a self-taught AI and analytics builder focused on combining tech + business thinking to create smarter systems and better decisions. I like turning messy informations into solutions and love to present them in dashboards, automations, and practical AI workflows that actually save time and drive results.
